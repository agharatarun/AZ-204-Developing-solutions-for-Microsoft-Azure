### COMPUTE
-----
* you can start testing your web app in a Free App Service plan and pay nothing. When you want to add your custom DNS name to the web app, just scale your plan up to Shared tier. Later, when you want to create a TLS binding, scale your plan up to Basic tier. When you want to have staging environments, scale up to Standard tier. When you need more cores, memory, or storage, scale up to a bigger VM size in the same tier. 
* Azure deploys each new **App Service plan** into a deployment unit, internally called a **webspace**. Each region can have many webspaces, but your app can only move between plans that are created in the same webspace. An **App Service Environment** is an isolated webspace, so apps can be **moved between plans in the same App Service Environment**, but not between plans in different App Service Environments.
* You can't specify the webspace you want when creating a plan, but it's possible to ensure that a plan is created in the same webspace as an existing plan. In brief, all plans created with the same resource group, region combination and operating system are deployed into the same webspace. For example, if you created a plan in resource group A and region B, then any plan you subsequently create in resource group A and region B is deployed into the same webspace.
* Note that plans can't move webspaces after they're created, so you can't move a plan into "the same webspace" as another plan by moving it to another resource group.
* The region in which your app runs is the region of the App Service plan it's in. However, you cannot change an App Service plan's region. If you want to run your app in a different region, one alternative is **app cloning.** Cloning makes a copy of your app in a new or existing App Service plan in any region. You can find Clone App in the Development Tools section of the menu.
* App Service plans that have no apps associated with them still incur charges because they continue to reserve the configured VM instances. 
* Kudu app is accessible at: 
    * App not in Isolated tier: https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net
    * Internet-facing app in Isolated tier (App Service Environment): https://<app-name>.scm.<ase-name>.p.azurewebsites.net 
    * Internal app in Isolated tier (ILB App Service Environment): https://<app-name>.scm.<ase-name>.appserviceenvironment.net 


### Q&A
-----
* Question: How many resources can I move in a single operation? 
    * When possible, break large moves into separate move operations. Resource Manager immediately returns an error when there are more than 800 resources in a single operation. However, moving less than 800 resources may also fail by timing out. 

* Moving the blob from cool to hot does not modify it's modification date, and so it will be moved back to cool storage the next time lifecycle management runs. You need to either modify the rule to be based on last access date, or modify the file when moving it back so that the modification date is updated.

* By using repository namespaces, you can allow sharing a single registry across multiple groups within your organization. Registries can be shared across deployments and teams. Azure Container Registry supports nested namespaces, enabling group isolation. However, the registry manages all repositories independently, not as a hierarchy. The syntax is contoso.azurecr.io/marketing/website

* For Windows App Services, where can you choose to have logging saved to? - File system, and blob storage

* What does the CLI command 'az acr build --registry $ACR_NAME --image helloacrtasks:v1 .' do? - Performs a docker build and immediately pushes the result image into an ACR.

* CRON uses a "{second} {minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day-of-week}" format for expressions. The first "0" means that it runs when the second equals 0. The second "15,30,45" means when the minutes equal 15, 30 and 45. The third "0" means at midnight. So the answer is at 12:15, 12:30, and 12:45 every day.

* **Azure File Sync** service allows you to keep a **local copy of files** that are stored in the **Azure File Shares** in the cloud. While some users may opt to keep a full copy of their data locally, Azure File Sync additionally has the ability to transform Windows Server into a quick cache of your Azure file share. You can use any protocol that's available on Windows Server to access your data locally, including SMB, NFS, and FTPS. You can have as many caches as you need across the world. 

* Managed identities provide an identity for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. Applications may use the managed identity to obtain Azure AD tokens. You cannot configure multiple applications to use the same system-assigned identity. You must use a user-assigned identity for this purpose.

* Every Functions app is executed by a language-specific handler. While Azure Functions features many language handlers by default, there are cases where you may want to use other languages or runtimes. Custom handlers are lightweight web servers that receive events from the Functions host. Any language that supports HTTP primitives can implement a custom handler.

* What is the Azure CLI command to download application log files to the local disk? - az webapp log download --name mywebapp --resource-group myresourcegroup

* Redundancy ensures that your storage account meets its availability and durability targets even in the face of failures. **Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) copies your data synchronously across three Azure availability zones** in the primary region. - total 3

* Geo-redundant storage (GRS) copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region using LRS. It then copies your data asynchronously to a single physical location in the secondary region. Within the secondary region, your data is copied synchronously three times using LRS. - total 6

* Which of the following statements describes the type of data that can be retrieved using Microsoft Graph? - Microsoft Graph is the gateway to data and intelligence in Microsoft 365. All of the data contained in Microsoft 365, including documents, calendar, email, Teams, and people.

* ASP.NET applications can use the System.Diagnostics.Trace class to log information to the application diagnostic log. 
    * e.g. ``System.Diagnostics.Trace.TraceError("If you're seeing this, something bad happened");``
    * https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs

* Using Azure Spot Virtual Machines allows you to take advantage of our unused capacity at a significant cost savings. At any point in time when Azure needs the capacity back, the Azure infrastructure will evict Azure Spot Virtual Machines. VMs can be evicted based on capacity or the max price you set. When creating an Azure Spot Virtual Machine, you can set the eviction policy to Deallocate (default) or Delete. As well, pricing is variable. Even though there is no SLA (for obvious reasons), this is not the major risk to using spot instances.

* The API Management Gateway includes a powerful feature called Policies. What is the main function of policies? - Policies allow you to modify the behavior of the API using configuration instead of code. A policy can change both the inbound request and the outbound response.

* Which Durable Functions application pattern would you use for an Azure Function that only needs to run whenever an external API returns a status change? - The monitor pattern refers to a flexible, recurring process in a workflow. An example is polling until specific conditions are met. You can use a regular timer trigger to address a basic scenario, such as a periodic cleanup job, but its interval is static and managing instance lifetimes becomes complex. You can use Durable Functions to create flexible recurrence intervals, manage task lifetimes, and create multiple monitor processes from a single orchestration. An example of the monitor pattern is to reverse the earlier async HTTP API scenario. Instead of exposing an endpoint for an external client to monitor a long-running operation, the long-running monitor consumes an external endpoint, and then waits for a state change.

* The speed of an Azure Event Hub is determined by the number of Throughput units you reserve for it. You can set between 1 and 20 throughput units for the Event Hub. How fast does 1 throughput unit represent for data coming in to an Event Hub? - 1 MB per second or 1000 events per second (whichever comes first)

* ARM templates are said to have a declarative syntax. Why is a declarative syntax better than a programmatic approach?
    * You don't have to check if the resource exists, you simply declare that it should exist.
    * You don't need to worry about the order of operations to create resources (dependencies), Azure takes care of creating them in the correct order

* Which CosmosDB API format works best with document (JSON) data? - Core SQL
    * Core (SQL) API stores data in JSON document format. Cassandra API stores data in column-oriented schema. Gremlin API allows users to make graph queries and stores data as edges and vertices. MongoDB API also uses documents but is BSON format, which is a binary format and not text-based. Table API stores data in key/value format.

* You are a developer for Acme Inc. You have implemented Redis as a caching service and it's going great. You are running on a premium plan, and using the top 120 GB of memory cache. You'd like to increase the memory limit to 500 GB, but Redis does not support that. How can you get more memory when using Azure Redis? - Impelement the Redis Cluster feature, and add a second shard to double the memory available.

* You are a developer for Acme Inc. Your company's flagship application is the Wind Monitoring software that Wind Energy farms use to monitor their equipment. At the end of each day, the Wind Collector sends a message that contains all of the days statistics in JSON format which needs to be read, processed, and posted to the database. Which Azure Service is best for processing this type of data? - Service Bus

* For Linux App Services, where can you choose to have logging saved to? - File System Only
    * https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/capture-application-logs-app-service/2-enable-and-configure-app-service-application-logging

* A virtual machine (VM) is automatically assigned a private IP address from a range that you specify, based on the subnet in which the VM is deployed. The VM retains the address until the VM is deleted. Azure dynamically assigns the next available private IP address from the subnet you create a VM in. If you want a specific IP address from the subnet assigned to the VM, assign a static IP address.

* **ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform version of ASP.NET**. Ruby and Python are only natively supported on Linux. ASP.NET 4 is only supported on Windows.

* What is an App Service Plan? - A set of compute resources for a web app to run. These compute resources are analogous to the server farm in conventional web hosting. One or more apps can be configured to run on the same computing resources (or in the same App Service plan)

* Azure function: All triggers and bindings have a direction property in the function.json file. For triggers, the direction is always in. Input and output bindings use in and out. Some bindings support a special direction inout. If you use inout, only the Advanced editor is available via the Integrate tab in the portal.

* What does the PowerShell command 'Get-AzVMImageSku -Location "EastUS" -PublisherName "MicrosoftWindowsServer" -Offer "WindowsServer"' return? : A list of publicly available Windows Server OS images in the EastUS region.

* What type of storage container is specifically used to collect log and metric data from various Azure Resources so that it can be analyzed in Azure Monitor? : Log Analytics Workspace

* What container image formats does Azure Container Registry support? : Docker images, OCI (Open Container Initiative) images, OCI artifacts, Helm charts

* You have an Azure Container Instance with the DNS label "mycontainer". What is the public Fully-Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for that instance? : mycontainer.(azureregion).azurecontainer.io
    * ACI supports regular, confidential, and Spot containers. ACI can be used as single-instance or multi-instance via NGroups, or you can get orchestration capabilities by deploying pods in your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster via virtual nodes on ACI. For even faster startup times, ACI supports standby pools.

* What does the Azure Container Registry endpoint look like? : myprivateacr.azurecr.io

* A Kubernetes cluster is divided into two components: 1. Control plane: provides the core Kubernetes services and orchestration of application workloads. 2. Nodes: run your application workloads.

* Strong consistency is that, across the world, readers are guaranteed to always get the most recent committed version of an item. A client will never see a partially committed item. 

* ARR affinity: ARR-Application Request Routing. In a multi-instance deployment, ensure that the client is routed to the same instance for the life of the session. You can set this option to Off for stateless applications. 

* Always On: Keeps the app loaded even when there's no traffic. When Always On is not turned on (default), the app is unloaded after 20 minutes without any incoming requests. The unloaded app can cause high latency for new requests because of its warm-up time. When Always On is turned on, the front-end load balancer sends a GET request to the application root every five minutes. The continuous ping prevents the app from being unloaded.

* To implement infrastructure as code for your Azure solutions, use Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates). The template is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. 

* **AppServiceHTTPLogs are web logs. AppServiceAppLogs are application logs. AppServiceAuditLogs contain login activity via FTP and kudu. And AllMetrics are not logs, but performance metrics.**

* Scale out: Increase the number of VM instances that run your app. Basic, Standard, and Premium service plans scale out to as many as 3, 10, and 30 instances, respectively. App Service Environments in the Isolated tier further increase your scale-out count to 100 instances. 

* What advantage does the Compute-Optimized (Fsv2) instance family have over the General Purpose (Dsv4) instance family? : F-series VMs provide higher performance (ACU) per virtual CPU compared to D-series. The machine hardware is designed for CPU performance.

* Durable Functions is an extension of Azure Functions that lets you write stateful functions in a serverless compute environment. The extension lets you define stateful workflows by writing orchestrator functions and stateful entities by writing entity functions using the Azure Functions programming model. Behind the scenes, the extension manages state, checkpoints, and restarts for you, allowing you to focus on your business logic.

* When you create an app in App Service, it is put into an App Service plan. When the app runs, it runs on all the VM instances configured in the App Service plan. If multiple apps are in the same App Service plan, they all share the same VM instances. If you have multiple deployment slots for an app, all deployment slots also run on the same VM instances.

* To deploy complex solutions, you can break your Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template) into many related templates, and then deploy them together through a main template. The related templates can be separate files or template syntax that is embedded within the main template. To link a template, add a deployments resource to your main template. In the templateLink property, specify the URI of the template to include. - Microsoft.Resources/deployments

* A shared access signature (SAS) provides secure delegated access to resources in your storage account. With a SAS, you have granular control over how a client can access your data. **A stored access policy is defined on a resource container**, which can be a blob container, table, queue, or file share. The stored access policy can be used to manage constraints for one or more service shared access signatures. When you associate a service SAS with a stored access policy, **the SAS inherits the constraints-the start time, expiry time, and permissions-defined for the stored access policy. You can modify the stored access policy at any time after the SAS has been created.**

* API Management: Authentication is an inbound policy. Requests that fail to authenticate do not have the requests passed on to the API backend at all.

* Your Azure Web App is currently throwing a 500 server error when viewed. You'd like to see more detail on the error. In order to accomplish this, what app setting do you need to set, and to what value? : ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT="Development". The development environment can enable features that shouldn't be exposed in production. If the environment isn't set, it defaults to Production, which disables most debugging features. 

* Once you enable App Service Logging in the Azure Portal, how long does Azure keep it on? : App logs are the output of runtime trace statements in app code. App logging is primarily for apps in pre-production and for troublesome issues, because excessive logs can carry a performance hit and quickly consume storage; for this reason, logging to the file system is automatically disabled after 12 hours.

* You have a Timer Trigger Function that uses "0 5 * * * *" as it's timer setting. How often will the function run? : Once every hour of the day, at 5 minutes after the hour
